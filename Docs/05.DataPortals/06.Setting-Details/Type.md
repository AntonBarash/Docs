# Type

The **Type** column on a container field defines the variable that the input field represents in the database. There are three main types of values you can put in this field: system types, such as `System.String`; category types, which represent a sort of picklist; container types, which represent a link to another page or table if itâ€™s a one to many relationships.

### System Types

Most fields have a type value representing the `C#` type and database type backing the field. The value should be the name of a `C#` type appropriate for the [ControlType](ControlType.md), such as `System.String` for a [Text](../05.Control-Details/Text.md) control or `System.Decimal` for a [NumberFormatting](../05.Control-Details/NumberFormatting.md) control.

### Category Types

For [Category](../05.Control-Details/Category.md) and [Radio](../05.Control-Details/Radio.md) controls, the **Type** is not a `C#` type but rather a [Category](../04.Categories.md) defined elsewhere in the Excel sheet; these will look like `Form.<Name>` where `<Name>` is the name of another Excel sheet (or column in the `Categories` sheet). To allow selection of multiple values, enclose the type in `[]` brackets (e.g. `[Form.Name]`).

### Reference Types

For [Link](../05.Control-Details/Link.md), [Page](../05.Control-Details/Page.md), [Reference](../05.Control-Details/Reference.md), and [Table](../05.Control-Details/Table.md) controls, the **Type** represents another Container sheet; these will look like `Form.<Name>` where `<Name>` is the name of another Excel sheet. For [Table](../05.Control-Details/Table.md) controls, enclose the type in `[]` brackets (e.g. `[Form.Name]`) to represent the fact that a table stores many values.
