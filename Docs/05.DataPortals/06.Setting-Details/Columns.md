# Columns

The **Columns** column on a container field defines columns of the child or reference container that should be shown in the relevant control.

Using JSON notation, have the option to rename the column names from their defaults. If left blank, only each record ID is shown in the table.  

## Controls

The **Columns** column applies to the following controls:

- [Reference](../05.Control-Details/Reference.md)
- [Table](../05.Control-Details/Table.md)
