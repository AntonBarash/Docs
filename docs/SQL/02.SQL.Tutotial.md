# Overview 

In this section, we will introduce an example **relational data model** for a hotel reservation system, and then explain how we may query this model to retrieve specific results.

# Example Data Model: Hotel Reservation System

A Hotel Reservation System can be modeled witht the following sets of relational tables.

* HOTELS: This table would store information about each hotel, such as its name, address, and phone number. It might have the following columns:
** hotel_id: A unique identifier for each hotel.
** name: The name of the hotel.
** address: The street address of the hotel.
** phone: The phone number of the hotel.
** ROOMS: This table would store information about the rooms in each hotel, such as the room number and type (e.g. single, double, suite). It might have the following columns:
** room_id: A unique identifier for each room.
** hotel_id: The identifier for the hotel that the room belongs to. This column would be used to link the ROOMS table to the HOTELS table.
** room_number: The number assigned to the room.
** room_type: The type of room (e.g. single, double, suite).

* GUESTS: This table would store information about each guest, such as their name and contact information. It might have the following columns:
** guest_id: A unique identifier for each guest.
** first_name: The guest's first name.
** last_name: The guest's last name.
** email: The guest's email address.
** phone: The guest's phone number.

* RESERVATIONS: This table would store information about each reservation, including the dates of the reservation, the room booked, and the guest making the reservation. It might have the following columns:
** reservation_id: A unique identifier for each reservation.
** guest_id: The identifier for the guest who made the reservation. This column would be used to link the RESERVATIONS table to the GUESTS table.
** room_id: The identifier for the room that was reserved. This column would be used to link the RESERVATIONS table to the ROOMS table.
** check_in: The date the guest is scheduled to check in.
** check_out: The date the guest is scheduled to check out.

This is just one example of how you might design a relational data model for a hotel reservation system. There are many other ways you could structure the data, depending on the specific needs and requirements of your system.

# Example SQL Queries

Here are some example SELECT queries using the data model I described above:

To retrieve the names and addresses of all hotels:
```SELECT name, address
FROM HOTELS;
To retrieve the names and reservation dates of all guests who have made a reservation at a specific hotel:
Copy code
SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, R.check_in, R.check_out
FROM GUESTS G
INNER JOIN RESERVATIONS R ON G.guest_id = R.guest_id
INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
WHERE H.name = 'Hotel Name';```

To retrieve the names and room numbers of all guests currently checked into a specific hotel:

```SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, RO.room_number
FROM GUESTS G
INNER JOIN RESERVATIONS R ON G.guest_id = R.guest_id
INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
WHERE H.name = 'Hotel Name'
AND R.check_in <= CURRENT_DATE
AND R.check_out > CURRENT_DATE;```

To retrieve the names and room types of all guests who have stayed at a specific hotel:

```SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, RO.room_type
FROM GUESTS G
INNER JOIN RESERVATIONS R ON G.guest_id = R.guest_id
INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
WHERE H.name = 'Hotel Name';```


# Common Table Expression (CTE)

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `CREATE VIEW` statement. It can be used to simplify complex queries by breaking them up into smaller, more manageable pieces.

A CTE is defined using the `WITH` clause, which precedes the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `CREATE VIEW` statement. It can be used to reference one or more CTEs in a single query.

Here is the basic syntax for defining a CTE:

```WITH cte_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...) AS
(
    SELECT column_name1, column_name2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)```

Here is an example of how you might use a CTE to compute the total number of rooms and the total number of occupied rooms in each hotel:

```WITH rooms (hotel_id, num_rooms, num_occupied) AS
(
    SELECT R.hotel_id, COUNT(*) AS num_rooms, SUM(CASE WHEN R.room_id IN
        (SELECT room_id FROM RESERVATIONS WHERE check_in <= CURRENT_DATE AND check_out > CURRENT_DATE) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_occupied
    FROM ROOMS R
    GROUP BY R.hotel_id
)
SELECT H.name, R.num_rooms, R.num_occupied
FROM HOTELS H
INNER JOIN rooms R ON H.hotel_id = R.hotel_id;```

Here is another example that uses a CTE to compute the average length of stay for guests at each hotel:

```WITH stays (hotel_id, avg_stay) AS
(
    SELECT H.hotel_id, AVG(DATEDIFF(check_out, check_in)) AS avg_stay
    FROM RESERVATIONS R
    INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
    INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
    GROUP BY H.hotel_id
)
SELECT H.name, S.avg_stay
FROM HOTELS H
INNER JOIN stays S ON H.hotel_id = S.hotel_id;```
