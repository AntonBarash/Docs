Here are some more advanced SQL concepts and examples:

Subqueries: A subquery is a SELECT statement that is nested within another SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or SET statement. Subqueries are used to return data that will be used in the outer query. They can be used in the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses.
Here is an example of how you might use a subquery to retrieve the names of all guests who have made a reservation at a specific hotel:

Copy code
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM GUESTS
WHERE guest_id IN
    (SELECT guest_id
     FROM RESERVATIONS
     INNER JOIN ROOMS ON RESERVATIONS.room_id = ROOMS.room_id
     INNER JOIN HOTELS ON ROOMS.hotel_id = HOTELS.hotel_id
     WHERE HOTELS.name = 'Hotel Name');
Window functions: A window function performs a calculation across a set of rows that are related to the current row. It allows you to compute values such as running totals, moving averages, and rank.
Here is an example of how you might use a window function to compute the running total of reservations made by each guest:

Copy code
SELECT first_name, last_name, count(*) OVER (PARTITION BY guest_id ORDER BY reservation_id) as running_total
FROM RESERVATIONS
INNER JOIN GUESTS ON RESERVATIONS.guest_id = GUESTS.guest_id;
Pivot tables: A pivot table is a table that summarizes and rearranges data in a more meaningful and easier to understand format. It allows you to transform rows into columns, and vice versa.
Here is an example of how you might use a pivot table to summarize the number of reservations made by each guest at each hotel:

Copy code
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, H.name as hotel_name, COUNT(*) as num_reservations
    FROM RESERVATIONS R
    INNER JOIN GUESTS G ON R.guest_id = G.guest_id
    INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
    INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
    GROUP BY G.first_name, G.last_name, H.name
) AS source_table
PIVOT
(
    SUM(num_reservations)
    FOR hotel_name IN ([Hotel 1], [Hotel 2], [Hotel 3])
) AS pivot_table;
I hope these examples give you a sense of some of the more advanced SQL concepts and techniques! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
