# Style

The **Style** column on a container field selects one of a set of display styles that can be used for the control.

E.g. for [Table](../05.Control-Details/Table.md) controls, a style of `Condensed` displays the table in a stripped-down, condensed manner on screen.

Leaving this value blank results in the default display being used.

## Controls

The **Style** column applies to the following controls:

- [Table](../05.Control-Details/Table.md)
