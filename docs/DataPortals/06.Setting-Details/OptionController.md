# OptionController

The **OptionController** column defines the field used to determine visibility conditions for a control backed by a category. This is used with a pipe separated list  in the `AvailableWith` column of a container sheet. The `AvailbleWith` column defines which values of the `OptionController` column must be selected for that category value to be visible.

The OptionController has a similar but not identical behavior to [CategoryCondition](./CategoryCondition.md).

## Controls

The **OptionController** column applies to the following controls:

- [Category](../05.Control-Details/Category.md)
- [Pill](../05.Control-Details/Pill.md)
- [Radio](../05.Control-Details/Radio.md)
