# Updating a Data Portal

To update a DataPortal, make changes to the DataPortal's excel file, then reupload it on the Manage page. Adding new fields, containers, or changing control types to your data model only require changing a few fields.

!!! note
    A DataPortal can not detect renaming of a field. If you change a field name, it will delete the old field and add a new one. Changing the DisplayName is the recommended solution.
