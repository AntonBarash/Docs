# Updating a Data Portal

To update a DataPortal, make changes to the original excel file, then reupload it in the Manage page of your DataPortal. You can easily add new fields or containers to your data model.

!!! note
    A DataPortal can not detect renaming of a field. If you change a field name, it will delete the old field and add a new one. Changing the DisplayName is the recommended solution.
