# Overview

 Saving passwords and other access credentials in clear text on a file on your desktop, or on a sticky note posted on your desk, is neither secure nor scalable. Rather, the use of a password manager as an encrypted digital vault for all access credentials provides an easy-to-use, scalable and secure way to use, manage and share credentials, as needed. Password managers are especially useful when building data operations processes that integrate data from a number of different sources, each with its own unique access credentials.

 Composable provides a built-in password manager used to store and retrieve access credentials (e.g., username and password combinations, API secret keys, SSH tokens, etc.). You can think of Composable's password manager as a **Key Vault**, storing passwords and other credentials in an encrypted database. Keys in Composable **eliminates** the need to:

- store passwords in local files
- hard-code sensitive credential information in code or scripts
- share sensitive credential information via email or instant messages.

The benefits of using Composable's built-in Keys are:

- Ability to save all types of complex access credentials (everything from a password to an SSH token), in a secure way
- Central management of Keys at the User and Group level
- Ability to Tag Keys or place Keys in Folders, to support a larger project
- Ability to share Keys at a granular level (e.g., discover, execute, read, write) with Users and Groups
- Complete Audit trails
