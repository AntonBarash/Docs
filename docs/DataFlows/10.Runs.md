## Run Settings

In the DataFlow Designer Settings, there is an option to turn off Saving Runs.

On the Run History page, the Run Settings panel allows the user to

- **Keep All Errors**: Runs that errored will not be removed.
- **Avoid Saving Activated Runs**: Runs activated outside of the designer, such as from activation modules or timers, will not be saved.
