Composable is a full-stack dataops (data operations) environment for seamlessly executing all levels of data orchestration and processing, e.g., Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL); Querying, Processing, Visualization and Dissemination.

The main capabilities offered by Composable are organized around product areas for:

- Data Processing & Transformations
- Data Exploration
- Data Modeling & Storage

# Data Processing & Transformations
