# Optional Settings

Several additional options allow you to customize the syncing behavior.

## Permissions

By default, permissions are not synced. Any resources that already exist on the target will preserve their permissions while resources that are created by the deployment will grant no access except to the owner (which will be the user account set in [`TargetConnectionSettings`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_TargetConnectionSettings)). This behavior can be changed by setting [`SyncSettings.SyncPermissions`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_SyncPermissions).

### Sync Permissions

If the boolean option [`SyncSettings.SyncPermissions`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_SyncPermissions) is `true`, then permissions for all DataFlows, QueryViews, and Folders will be copied from the source to the target. This includes the setting to inherit folder permissions, and for Folders includes both content permissions and folder permissions. Permissions granted to "Everyone" or "Anyone with an Account" are always preserved, but other permission mapping is done by name, either by the name of a group or by the username for individual user permissions. If a group or user does not exist on the target those permissions are lost and a warning is printed.

### Required Group Names

To avoid losing desired permissions accidentally, the [`SyncSettings.RequiredGroupNames`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_RequiredGroupNames) option allows you to specify a list of groups by name that are expected to exist on the target server, usually because they have permissions you would like to set during the sync. If any of the required groups are missing, [`FolderSyncer.Sync`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.FolderSyncer.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_FolderSyncer_Sync) will fail **before saving any resources to the target**. The error message will contain the name of the first missing group.

If [`SyncSettings.RequiredGroupNames`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_RequiredGroupNames) is empty or not set no check will be made.

## Keys and Other Identifiers

Every QueryView references a key for its database connection, and DataFlows may reference keys through modules. DataFlows may also refer directly to DataPortals and alerts. During sync, these references are mapped so they refer to the appropriate resource on the target so long as that resource exists. Identification of the matching target resource is primarily done by name, though an option exists to slightly modify this behavior for keys, described below.

When a resource is missing, the behavior depends on the type of resource. 

- If a DataPortal cannot be found, a warning is printed and the reference is nulled out. The resulting target DataFlow will not work correctly until the DataPortal is created and the reference is updated (either manually or by running another sync).
- If an alert cannot be found, it will be automatically created and associated with the appropriate target dataflow and module. All DataFlows depending on this alert should behave as expected
- If a key cannot be found, by default a warning is printed and the reference is nulled out. The resulting target DataFlow or QueryView will not work correctly until the key is created and the reference is updated (either manually or by running another sync). This behavior can be modified by the [`SyncSettings.MissingKeyBehavior`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_MissingKeyBehavior) option.

### Missing Key Behavior

Four options exist for [`SyncSettings.MissingKeyBehavior`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_MissingKeyBehavior):

- [`MissingKeyBehavior.Warn`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.MissingKeyBehavior.html): Null out the reference to the missing key and print a warning. **This is the default behavior.**
- [`MissingKeyBehavior.Throw`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.MissingKeyBehavior.html): Throw an exception, halting execution when a key is missing. Because resources are saved sequentially, this may result in a partial deployment of resources, but no individual resource will be saved without all key references.
- [`MissingKeyBehavior.Create`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.MissingKeyBehavior.html): Create a new key on the target with the appropriate name and (if applicable) folder. Update this and any other references to the missing key (within synced resources) to the newly created key. This newly created key will have no value, which will cause resources referencing it to not work until the key is updated to have the proper value, but no updates to the DataFlows and QueryViews themselves is required. A warning is printed for every created key.
- [`MissingKeyBehavior.Copy`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.MissingKeyBehavior.html): Copy the source key to the target, preserving its value. This is the option most likely to guarantee synced resources can run immediately after a deployment, but may result in undesired behavior if key values should be different between environments (e.g. dev and prod database connections). A warning is printed for every copied key. **It is highly recommended you review all copied values to ensure they are correct for the new environment.**

### Require Foldered Keys

By default, keys are matched by name only. If multiple keys exist with the same name but one of them is in a folder corresponding to the folder of the source key that one will be chosen, but no other folder requirements are applied. If [`SyncSettings.RequireFolderedKeys`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_RequireFolderedKeys) is `true`, then *only* keys in the target folder(s) will be considered potential matches. This option is most useful when the synced environments are on the same Composable instance but should not share keys.

## Unsynced Resources

By default, syncing will affect only the resources that exactly match those in the source folder, with a couple minor exceptions (see [here](../Possible-Issues.md)). This means that additional DataFlows and QueryViews can exist in the target folders. In some cases this may be useful, if those resources are only useful on the target server. On the other hand, this creates a disconnect between the two servers that can be confusing and sometimes is just additional clutter. One case in which the latter is more likely is when resources that were originally synced become unneeded for the project and are moved or deleted from the source folder. In this case, with the default behavior of [`FolderSyncer.Sync`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.FolderSyncer.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_FolderSyncer_Sync) the target versions of those resources will remain in place unless moved or deleted manually.

### UnsyncedResourceBehavior

[`SyncSettings.UnsyncedResourceBehavior`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_UnsyncedResourceBehavior) provides options for what to do with DataFlows and QueryViews within target folders that are not also present in the corresponding source folders.

- [`UnsyncedResourceBehavior.Ignore`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.UnsyncedResourceBehavior.html): Leave unmatched resources in place. **This is the default behavior.**
- [`UnsyncedResourceBehavior.Warn`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.UnsyncedResourceBehavior.html): Leave unmatched resources in place but print a warning about each resource.
- [`UnsyncedResourceBehavior.Deprecate`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.UnsyncedResourceBehavior.html): Move unmatched resources to a folder specified by [`SyncSettings.DeprecationFolder`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_DeprecationFolder), with default value `"/Deprecated"`. 
- [`UnsyncedResourceBehavior.Delete`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.UnsyncedResourceBehavior.html): Delete unmatched resources.

### Resource Transformation

For transformations not captured by the default mapping behavior or other optional settings, use [`SyncSettings.ApplicationTransform`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_ApplicationTransform) and [`SyncSettings.QueryViewTransform`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_QueryViewTransform). These options allow you to call a method on every DataFlow or QueryView before saving it, making any required changes. This allows you to make essentially any change you'd like to one or more DataFlows or QueryViews.

For example, if you wanted to disable all timer-activated DataFlows except one called `"SQL DB Backup"`, you could write
```csharp
syncSettings.ApplicationTransform = (app) =>
{
    if (!app.Value.Name.Equals("SQL DB Backup", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        foreach (Module module in app.Modules)
        {
            if (module.ModuleType.Name == "Timer")
            {
                foreach (ModuleInput input in module.ModuleInputs)
                {
                    if (input.Name == "Enabled")
                    {
                        input.ValueObj = false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
The input `app` is a [`Resource<Application>`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.Resource-1.html) where [`Application`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.Contracts.Application.html) is a contract for a DataFlow. Through that object we check the DataFlow name, then loop through modules looking for one with module type `"Timer"`. Then we loop through the module inputs to find the `"Enabled"` input and set its value to `false`.

**If [`ApplicationTransform`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_ApplicationTransform) (or [`QueryViewTransform`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_QueryViewTransform)) is set, it will be called on every synced DataFlow (or QueryView), so be sure to write your tranform in such a way that it will only change DataFlows (or QueryViews) you want to change.**

### Sync Run Retention Settings

If the boolean option [`SyncSettings.SyncRetentionSettings`](https://dev.composable.ai/api/CompAnalytics.IServices.Deploy.SyncSettings.html#CompAnalytics_IServices_Deploy_SyncSettings_SyncRetentionSettings) is `true`, then run retention settings for all DataFlows will be copied from the source to the target. These settings are visible on the runs page for a DataFlow and include things like "Days to Keep Runs".

If this option is `false` or not set, DataFlows that already exist on the target will preserve their run retention settings while DataFlows that are created by the deployment will have default settings.
