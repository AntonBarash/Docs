# Add

Add the given collection to the query. Note that this does not add any fields to the query and thus does not re-evaluate the query.

The newly added collection will appear in the list of included collections in the `Query` sidebar.

This option is available only for collections in the `Suggested Collections` section of the `Query` sidebar. To examine the definition of such a collection before adding it to the collection, use the [Edit](./Edit.md) option instead.
