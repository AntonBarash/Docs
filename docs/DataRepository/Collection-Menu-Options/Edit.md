# Edit

View and modify the definition of the given collection. This option is available for nested collections included in the query and for suggested collections, but is not available for the root collection.

This option will open a window like the one used to create new collections; see [Adding Collections](../DataQuery-Details.md#adding-collections) for more details. To save changes to the collection click `Save`; to return to the query without modifying the collection, click `Cancel`.
