# Link

Create a new nested collection linked to the given collection.

This option is available for any collection included in the query, whether it has visible fields or not. It is not available for suggested collections.

This option will open a window used to create new collections; see [Adding Collections](../DeepQuery-Details.md#adding-collections) for more details. The **Origin Field** for the first link condition will be restricted to be a field of the given collection; subsequent link conditions can use any field of an ancestor collection as the origin field.

To save the new collection and add it to the query click `Save`; to return to the query without adding a collection, click `Cancel`.
