# Rename

Modify the displayed name of the given collection. This sets or modifies the `Alias` property of the collection, which is directly visible via the [Edit](./Edit.md) option.

It is also possible to rename a collection by clicking on the collection name inside the label. This will make the field editable; simply type the desired name and then click outside the label to save. To remove an `Alias` and return to the default name, simply delete all the text in the field and click outside the label.
