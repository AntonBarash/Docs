# Simple Fields

Simple fields represent values pulled directly from the data source underlying the repository. When a collection is added to the query, a new simple field is added to the sidebar for each [Field](../Repository-Details.md#fields) in the underlying repository [Collection](../Repository-Details.md#collections). Thus each simple field corresponds to a single field in the repository, but a single repository field may be represented by multiple simple fields in the DeepQuery if its containing collection is included multiple times.
