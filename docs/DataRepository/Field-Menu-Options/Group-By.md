# Group By

Add the selected field to the set of fields being grouped by. See [Grouping](../QueryDive-Details.md#grouping) for additional details.

This option is available for any field that is not already being grouped by, whether it is included in the query or not. Selecting this option will add a non-included field to the query as a hidden field.

When a field is being grouped by, its label will show the grouped icon.
