# Link

Create a new nested collection linked to the given field.

This option is available for field on a collection included in the query, whether the field itself is included or not. Saving a link through this option will add non-included fields to the query as hidden fields.

This option will open a window used to create new collections; see [Adding Collections](../DeepQuery-Details.md#adding-collections) for more details. The **Origin Field** for the first link condition will be restricted to be the selected field; subsequent link conditions can use any field of an ancestor collection as the origin field.

To save the new collection and add it to the query click `Save`; to return to the query without adding a collection, click `Cancel`.
