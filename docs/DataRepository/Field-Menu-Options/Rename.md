# Rename

Modify the displayed name of the given field. This sets or modifies the `Alias` property of the field, which is directly visible via the [Edit](./Edit.md) option for some fields.

It is also possible to rename a field by clicking on the field name inside the label. This will make the field editable; simply type the desired name and then click outside the label to save. To remove an `Alias` and return to the default name, simply delete all the text in the field and click outside the label.
