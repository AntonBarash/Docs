# Aggregate

Create an [aggregate field](../Field-Types/Aggregate.md) using the selected field as the source.

This option will open a window used to create new fields; see [Creating Fields](../DeepQuery-Details.md#creating-fields) for more details. The **Source Field** for the new aggregate field will be restricted to be the selected field.

To save the new field and add it to the query click `Save`; to return to the query without adding a field, click `Cancel`.
