In the **BlueBikes** entry in the **Project Lab Series** we will utilize three building blocks of the Composable platform: DataFlows, DataPortals, and QueryViews.  

We will use the **[DataFlow](../../DataFlows/01.Overview.md)** to extract our BlueBikes Data and transform it into tabular format.

The **[DataPortal](../../DataPortals/01.Overview.md)** will let us create a database, then load our tabular data.

With the **[QueryView](../../QueryViews/01.Overview.md)**, we will be able to review our stored data, create a simple UI to filter data interactively, and use a hyperlink to generate a route map for our bike trip.

Let's get started!
