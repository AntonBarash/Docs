# Overview 

In this section, we will introduce an example **relational data model** for a hotel reservation system, and then explain how we may query this model to retrieve specific results.

# Example Data Model: Hotel Reservation System

A Hotel Reservation System can be modeled witht the following sets of relational tables.

* `HOTELS`: This table would store information about each hotel, such as its name, address, and phone number. It might have the following columns:
    * `hotel_id`: A unique identifier for each hotel.
    * `name`: The name of the hotel.
    * `address`: The street address of the hotel.
    * `phone`: The phone number of the hotel.

* `ROOMS`: This table would store information about the rooms in each hotel, such as the room number and type (e.g. single, double, suite). It might have the following columns:
    * `room_id`: A unique identifier for each room.
    * `hotel_id`: The identifier for the hotel that the room belongs to. This column would be used to link the ROOMS table to the HOTELS table.
    * `room_number`: The number assigned to the room.
    * `room_type`: The type of room (e.g. single, double, suite).

* `GUESTS`: This table would store information about each guest, such as their name and contact information. It might have the following columns:
    * `guest_id`: A unique identifier for each guest.
    * `first_name`: The guest's first name.
    * `last_name`: The guest's last name.
    * `email`: The guest's email address.
    * `phone`: The guest's phone number.

* RESERVATIONS`: This table would store information about each reservation, including the dates of the reservation, the room booked, and the guest making the reservation. It might have the following columns:
* `reservation_id`: A unique identifier for each reservation.
* `guest_id`: The identifier for the guest who made the reservation. This column would be used to link the RESERVATIONS table to the GUESTS table.
* `room_id`: The identifier for the room that was reserved. This column would be used to link the RESERVATIONS table to the ROOMS table.
* `check_in`: The date the guest is scheduled to check in.
* `check_out`: The date the guest is scheduled to check out.

This is just one example of how you might design a relational data model for a hotel reservation system. There are many other ways you could structure the data, depending on the specific needs and requirements of your system.

# Example SQL Queries

Here are some example SELECT queries using the data model I described above:

To retrieve the names and addresses of all hotels:

``` sql
SELECT name, address
FROM HOTELS;
```

To retrieve the names and reservation dates of all guests who have made a reservation at a specific hotel:

``` sql
SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, R.check_in, R.check_out
FROM GUESTS G
INNER JOIN RESERVATIONS R ON G.guest_id = R.guest_id
INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
WHERE H.name = 'Hotel Name';
```

To retrieve the names and room numbers of all guests currently checked into a specific hotel:

``` sql
SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, RO.room_number
FROM GUESTS G
INNER JOIN RESERVATIONS R ON G.guest_id = R.guest_id
INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
WHERE H.name = 'Hotel Name'
AND R.check_in <= CURRENT_DATE
AND R.check_out > CURRENT_DATE;
```

To retrieve the names and room types of all guests who have stayed at a specific hotel:

``` sql
SELECT G.first_name, G.last_name, RO.room_type
FROM GUESTS G
INNER JOIN RESERVATIONS R ON G.guest_id = R.guest_id
INNER JOIN ROOMS RO ON R.room_id = RO.room_id
INNER JOIN HOTELS H ON RO.hotel_id = H.hotel_id
WHERE H.name = 'Hotel Name';
```
