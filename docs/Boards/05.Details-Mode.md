# Details Mode

The details mode allows you to view and edit some of the meta-data regarding your board.

Like on the edit page, you can edit the name, description, and folder of your board from the Details page. You can also edit your board's tags, and add or remove a board from your favorites.

The details page also allows you to see a board's activity, and add/view comments about the board.
